This has led to a lack of engagement from fans in the overall experience of the game.\nThere is a need for a better mechanism aimed towards keeping the fan experience at the center and thereby encouraging more active participation from fans during cricket matches.\nDespite the presence of contests and other activities during matches, only a small percentage of fans actually participate in them due to a lack of incentives.\nFans are still required to bring physical copies of tickets to enter the stadium for live matches, which is an outdated system.\nThis outdated ticketing system leads to corruption and inflated prices for tickets.\nThe current ticketing system only serves the purpose of allowing entry into the stadium to watch the live match and does not offer any additional benefits or functionality to enhance the fan experience.\n\nidea:\nImplementing NFTs as ticket wallets for matches, can provide more value to the fans and enhance the overall fan experience. It would hold value in the form of tokens, which can be spent on food, merchandise, or other offerings at the stadium.\nThis can also serve as an entry point to participate in further contests during the game, providing an incentive for fans to engage actively and potentially earn more tokens.\nFans would have a unique avatar, created at the time of profile creation. As the user engages with ICC/FIFA/FIA etc and its products, participates in contests using tokens, the avatar level increases along with the potential to earn more tokens. Once a certain level has been reached, the fans get access to VIP areas, meet players, get signed match ball, etc.\nThis proposed solution offers a better way for viewers to engage with the game and offers incentives for more active participation.\nLack of fan engagement during sports matches is an existing problem.\nProposed solution is a one stop platform for fans to play, buy and interact with ICC/FIFA/FIA etc, products.\nProviding incentives and rewards through tokens, games and contests encourages active participation during the match.\nTokens can be used for various activities like redeeming food at stadium, access to exclusive merchandise, participating in contests, etc.\nAvatar on the other hand has a more significant role wherein users can get access to VIP areas, exclusive meetups with players, etc\nThis leads to a more enjoyable fan experience and a boost in overall viewership.\n\nfeatures:\n\nTicket associated with tokens.\nTokens can be used to buy food, goodies, and redeemable for merchandise, entry to contests.\nTickets as tokens provide hassle-free entry to stadiums, matches, and other contests.\nQR associated with each ticket, so that the user doesn't have to wait in the long queues for buying food or entry into stadiums.\nThe tokens get deducted from the user and gets transferred to the seller upon scanning.\nThese tickets can be transferred after a match.\n\nA personalised Avatar is given to each user upon signing in.\nThese avatars act as a entry point to exclusive events like meet and greet with cricketers, signed ball, chat with commentator, access to ground and VIP boxes.\nThe more the user interacts with products of ICC/FIFA etc, the more contests he wins, the more his avatar levels up\nAs you progress through levels with your avatar, you will receive a distinctive accessory that becomes increasingly rare as you advance.
